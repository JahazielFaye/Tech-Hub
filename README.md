# Tech-Hub
a CMS-style blog site built from scratch, following the MVC architectural structure and using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Similar to a Wordpress site, developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The site is deployed to Heroku and provides a platform for organizing and sharing various kinds of content.
